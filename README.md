# **Graph Neural Networks - From Zero to Hero**

This repository contains materials used for the **International Conference on Advanced Research in Computing (ICARC-2025)** on **Graph Neural Networks - From Zero to Hero**.

## ðŸ“Œ Workshop Overview

Our workshop is divided into five sessions:

| Session | Topic | Notes | Colab Notebook |
|---------|------------------------------------|--------|----------------|
| 1 | Introduction to fundamental theory and concepts of GNNs | | [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1dMpYBM49XwMrFzwg-pFEIFd7oeZM_DfE?usp=sharing) |
| 2 | MPGNN from the scratch | | [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1ARvYScDoATR1TGAzSuP146fFLXf1Ektd?usp=sharing) |
| 3 | GCN Architecture |  | [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/14psKVM8z11BCLsyJt5iu9svynZgzZXIH?usp=sharing) |
| 4 | GAT Architecture |  | [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1thBwQBijbx5x7oQJMDluhT8Rpu9KFK9o?usp=sharing) |
| 5 | GNN Application | | [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1GIrwKJCs9hOAHQf9teW0RsNQfx3E1tF8?usp=sharing) |

> ðŸ“Œ **Note:** The notebooks are designed to run standalone and include all necessary setup installations.  
> We highly recommend running them in **Google Colab** for the best experience.
